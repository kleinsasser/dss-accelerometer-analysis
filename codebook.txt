ARGUMENTS
directory - directory containing the Samsung Accelerometer data, defaults to working directory.

VARIABLE NAMES
subject - id of the subject who was wearing the accelerometer from which the data was recorded
activity - descriptive activity name of the actions being performed while the data was being collected
columns 3:68 - accelerometer data as described by the following link specifically. http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

FUNCTION STEPS
1. Sets working directory to the assigned directory using the 'directory' argument
2. Reads necessary files from the directory using the read.table function
3. Adds descriptive variable names to the subject and activity data sets
4. Assigns descriptive activity names in place of id numbers in the activity data set
5. Combines the test and train data sets in all the raw data, subject data, and activity data using the rbind function
6. Uses the cbind function to merge the raw, subject, and activity data into one data frame
7. Takes a subset of the previous data frame extracting only data regarding means and standard deviations, this data frame will be found in the global environment and will be called 'allfinal'
8. Uses the reshape2 package to reshape the data and summarize with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
9. Returns the dataset from step 8, this will also be found in the global environment called 'meanstable'
